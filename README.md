As urban populations grow and their vulnerability increase, managing urban growth in a way that fosters citiesâ€™ resilience to natural hazards and the impacts of climate change becomes an ever-greater challenge that requires detailed, up-to- date geographic data of the built environment. Addressing this challenge requires innovative, open, and dynamic data collection and mapping processes that support management of urban growth and disaster risk. Success is often contingent on: local capacities and networks to maintain and utilize risk information, enabling policy environments to support effective data management and sharing, and targeted tools that can help translate data into meaningful action.
